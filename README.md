# HERON UOM ROBOTICS

In this repository, our team members upload **code** files (.ino for Arduino) and other **useful documentation** (e.g. .txt for hardware instructions-making). 

For greater projects, it is possible for members to have their own branch where they commit files, before an administrator approves their changes and commits it to the main branch. 

Keep in mind this is a **private repository** and most of the files shall not be published. If you wish to publicly upload something, make sure to get approval of the administrator.
