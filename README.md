# HERON UOM ROBOTICS

In this repository, our team members upload code files (.ino for Arduino) and other useful documentation (e.g. .txt for hardware instructions-making). 
For greater projects, it is possible for members to have their own branch where they commit files, before an administrator approves their changes and commits it to the main branch.
