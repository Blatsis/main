PURPOSE OF CIRCUIT: 
 This circuit makes a LED shine for 3 seconds.Then it turns off for 3 sec while a buzzer starts "buzzing" for 3 seconds.Finally the buzzer stops and LED starts shining again,repeating the same prossedure.
HARDWARE USED: 
- Arduino UNO R3 
- Breadboard, wires, 2 buttons, 2 resistors of 220Î©,1 buzzer
HARDWARE CONNECTIONS:
References to : 
- Globals/ Constants on code :
 The red LED is reffered to as "LED_BUILTIN".The buzzer is reffered to as the number "9".

Basic connections between a part/port/pin of equipment and the other end they matched:
 The LED's long leg is plugged in Digital Pin (PWD) number 13, and its short leg goes to a 
GND pin to the Arduino board
 The buzzer's "positive" (+) leg is plugged in a Digital PIn (PWD) number 9 and the "negative" (-) leg goes to a GND pin to the Arduino Board.>
