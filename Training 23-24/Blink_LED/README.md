PURPOSE OF CIRCUIT: 
This circuit makes a LED shine for 1 second, then turns it off for another 1 sec, and repeats.
---------------------------------------------------
HARDWARE USED: 
 - Arduino UNO R3 
 - Breadboard, 
 - 2 wires
 - 1 resistor (330Î©)
 - 1 LED (red)
---------------------------------------------------
HARDWARE CONNECTIONS:
References to :  
 - GLOBALS/ CONSTANTS 
   ---> The red LED is reffered to as "LED", type of integer (constant), with global scope. This constant is matched with the value of "12".

 - CRUSIAL CONNECTIONS
   ---> The LED's short leg is plugged in Digital Pin (PWD) number 12, and its long leg goes to a GND pin straight to the Arduino board.
